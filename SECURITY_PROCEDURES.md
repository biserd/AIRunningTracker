# Security Procedures & Incident Response

## Overview

This document outlines security procedures and incident response protocols for RunAnalytics, particularly regarding data breaches involving third-party integrations like Strava.

## Security Breach Response Protocol

### Immediate Response (0-1 hour)

1. **Incident Detection**
   - Monitor security alerts from application logs, monitoring systems, or user reports
   - Identify scope and nature of potential security incident
   - Document the time of initial discovery

2. **Initial Assessment**
   - Determine if user data, particularly Strava data, is potentially compromised
   - Assess whether the incident involves unauthorized access to:
     - User accounts and authentication data
     - Strava access tokens or refresh tokens
     - Activity data obtained from Strava API
     - Personal information linked to Strava accounts

3. **Immediate Containment**
   - Isolate affected systems if necessary
   - Revoke potentially compromised API tokens
   - Implement emergency access controls
   - Document all containment actions taken
