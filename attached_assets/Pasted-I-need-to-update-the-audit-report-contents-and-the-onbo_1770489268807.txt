I need to update the audit-report contents and the onboarding wizard after the user connects its strava. 

After the user connects its strava and we sync their activities, before we show the Audit report, we ask them three simple questions in a very elegant way.

Title: "Calibrating your profile..."

Step 1: The Goal (The North Star)
"To build your perfect plan, what is your primary focus right now?"

[Option A] Crush a Race: I have a specific race coming up (5k, 10k, Half, Full).
[Option B] Get Faster: I want to beat my PRs, but no specific race yet.
[Option C] Build Endurance: I want to run longer without stopping.
[Option D] Stay Injury Free: I want to run consistently without getting hurt.

Step 2: The Struggle ( The Pain Point)
"What has been your biggest frustration with training recently?"

[Option A] Plateau: I’m running hard but not getting faster.
[Option B] Burnout/Fatigue: I often feel tired or heavy-legged.
[Option C] Inconsistency: I have trouble sticking to a schedule.
[Option D] Guesswork: I don't know if I'm training correctly.

Step 3: The Commitment (The Reality Check)
"To hit your goal, how many days per week can you realistically train?"

[3 Days]
[4 Days]
[5+ Days]

All questions are mandatory and must be stored in our database.

Based on their answers we calibrate and show them the Audit report:

How the Result Page Changes (Dynamic Copy)
Now, your landing page isn't generic. It echoes their answers back to them. This creates High Relevance.

Scenario A: The "Racer" (Selected: Race + Plateau)
Headline: "Break through your plateau and smash your Half Marathon."

The Hook: "You want to race in October, but your current 'Grey Zone' training is causing you to plateau. Our data predicts a 1:58 finish, but with the right structure, you can hit 1:45."

The Solution: "Here is your 4-day/week plan to peak exactly on race day."

Scenario B: The "Injury Prone" (Selected: Injury Free + Burnout)
Headline: "Stop the cycle of overtraining and injury."

The Hook: "You reported feeling tired. Our analysis confirms why: 37% of your miles are 'Junk Mileage'. You are overloading your joints without gaining fitness."

The Solution: "Here is a 'Safe-Build' plan that prioritizes recovery and sustainable volume."

Implementation Tip: Make the wizard visually engaging. Don't use standard form inputs. Use big, tappable cards. Add a small "analyzing..." animation between steps to make it feel like the AI is crunching their specific data.
