Here’s a clean, “coach-like” behavior for each button that matches what you’ve built (sync + linking + adjustment + progressive enrichment). The key is: **each click triggers a small, deterministic workflow + a visible outcome**.

---

## 1) Sync Activities

### What it should do

1. **Pull recent Strava activities** (default: last 14 days, or since `lastIncrementalSince`)
2. **Auto-link activities → plan days**

   * Match by date ± tolerance (0–1 day), distance tolerance, type=Run
3. **Update adherence**

   * Day status: completed / partial / missed / skipped
   * Week totals + adherenceScore
4. **Generate a “Last 7 days” summary** (planned vs done)
5. Show feedback in UI

### UX outcome

* Immediately show: “Syncing…” spinner
* When done: “✅ Synced 6 runs, linked 5 to your plan”
* Update the week view colors instantly
* Optional: surface “Missed key workout” callouts

**Bonus:** if you detect the user is behind/ahead, show a small suggestion:

* “You missed the tempo run—want to adjust next week?” (link to tired/strong)

## 2) “I’m tired”

Think of this as: **reduce injury risk and restore consistency**.

### What it should do

1. Require quick input (lightweight, optional):

   * Fatigue level (1–5) OR just a single click
   * Optional checkbox: “Niggle/injury”
2. Call your adjust endpoint to modify **next 7 days** (or next 14 if you prefer)
3. Apply deterministic rules before/after LLM:

   * Reduce next week volume **10–20%**
   * Remove/soften **one** quality workout (intervals→easy, tempo→steady)
   * Keep long run but shorten it (e.g., -10–20%)
   * Add/keep at least 1 extra rest or recovery emphasis
4. Save adjusted days, mark:

   * `PlanWeek.wasAdjusted = true`
   * Store adjustment reason (“tired”) and timestamp
5. Generate a short “coach note” explaining what changed

### UX outcome

* Show: “Adjusting next week…”
* When done:

  * “✅ Next week eased by 15% and intensity reduced”
  * Highlight changed workouts (small “Adjusted” pill)
* Coach Notes panel updates with:

  * “You indicated fatigue, so we reduced volume and swapped intervals for an easy run.”

## 3) “I’m strong”

This is **not** “make it way harder.” It’s: **progress safely or sharpen slightly**.

### What it should do

1. Optional quick input:

   * “Feeling strong” + (optional) “slept well / low stress”
2. Adjust only **next 7 days** (or 14)
3. Safe rules:

   * Increase next week volume by **0–10%** (cap hard at 15%)
   * Do **not** add extra quality days
   * Slightly progress the existing quality session (more reps, slightly longer tempo)
   * Keep long run progression modest (+1–2km max)
4. Save + mark `wasAdjusted=true`
5. Write coach note (“we’re building on momentum”)

### UX outcome

* Show: “Tuning next week…”
* When done:

  * “✅ Next week progressed slightly (+6%) with a stronger tempo session”
  * Highlight what changed

## One important behavior for BOTH tired/strong

Before adjusting, do an automatic “mini sync” check:

* If the user hasn’t synced in a while, prompt:

  * “Want to sync your recent runs first so adjustments are based on actual training?”
  * Default action: run sync in the background anyway, then adjust.

This keeps adjustments grounded.

---

## What NOT to do

* Don’t adjust the entire 14-week plan on each click. Users will feel like the plan is unstable.
* Don’t rewrite past weeks.
* Don’t change run days (keep the schedule stable).

If you want, I can write the exact backend flow as a short spec (endpoints + event names for SSE + DB fields to update) so the behavior is fully consistent and debuggable.
