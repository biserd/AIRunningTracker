Got it. Below is a **developer-clear spec** for **Story** (default) and **Deep Dive** (evidence), using the **components you already have** in the screenshot, plus a **Goal/Plan layer** (incl. “Take a rest day”) and **Free/Pro/Premium gating** that stays user-friendly.

---

# 1) Component inventory (what you already have)

Use these exact names (or close) so your devs can map 1:1:

1. **Activity Header**

   * Title (“Afternoon Run”), date, “View on Strava”, “Share”, view toggle (Story / Deep Dive / Minimal)
2. **Key Stats Strip**

   * Distance, Time, Pace, Avg HR, Elev Gain, Avg Power, Avg Cadence (icons row)
3. **Coach Verdict Card**

   * Grade (C), label (“Solid Effort”), short explanation
   * “vs last 42 days” deltas (Pace/HR/Effort/Distance)
4. **Next 48 Hours Card**

   * Harder effort guidance, Recovery window, Training guidance, Coach tip
   * (You mentioned you already have actions like “Take a rest day”)
5. **Run Timeline Chart**

   * Toggle metrics (Pace/HR/Power/Cadence) + Elevation overlay, with legend/markers
   * Chips: Drift %, Pacing %, Quality %, HR baseline (etc.)
6. **Route & Details**

   * Map + Details table (type, avg/max HR, stop time, elevation range, avg/max power, etc.)
7. **Performance Analysis**

   * Cards: Pace Analysis, Running Form, Heart Rate Zone (short text)
8. **Detailed Charts & Splits**

   * Detailed Splits Analysis (table/chart/analysis toggle)
   * Heart Rate Analysis chart (zones)
   * Cadence Analysis chart
   * Power Analysis chart

---

# 2) STORY view (default): “Verdict → Why → What next → Proof-lite”

**Goal:** user understands the workout in **10 seconds** without scrolling forever.

## Story layout order (exact)

### S1) Activity Header (existing)

* Keep as-is.
* View toggle: **Story (default)**, Deep Dive.

### S2) Key Stats Strip (existing, but “Story-capped”)

* Show max **5 primary stats** in Story (recommend: Distance, Time, Pace, Avg HR, Effort/Load).
* Everything else behind **“More stats”** (opens modal or expands).

**Tier note:** Free shows 5; Pro/Premium can show 7 but still capped visually.

### S3) Coach Verdict Card (existing, elevated to “Hero”)

* Make it full-width and visually dominant.
* Content stays the same but with a strict structure:

  * Grade + label
  * 1-sentence summary
  * 2–3 bullets (“What went well / What limited you / One focus”)

**Move the “vs last 42 days” deltas** into:

* Pro/Premium: visible by default (small row)
* Free: collapsed with “Unlock comparisons”

### S4) Goals & Next 48 Hours (existing Next 48 Hours + new Goal Context)

Place these side-by-side on desktop:

**Left: Next 48 Hours (existing)**

* Keep: Recovery window + training guidance + coach tip
* Add **primary action buttons** (Goal-aware):

  * **Take a rest day** (always available if Training Plan exists; otherwise creates a “Rest Day” goal action)
  * **Mark next workout as Easy** (or “Swap next workout”)
  * **Add to plan** (if no plan: prompt to set a goal/plan)

**Right: Goal Alignment Card (NEW but simple)**

* Reads from your existing goal/plan facilities
* Example fields:

  * Current Goal: “Base building / Marathon / 5K PR / Weekly mileage”
  * Progress: “This run: 4.35 mi → Week: 12.8/25 mi”
  * Alignment: “On track / Slightly high intensity / Needs more Z2”
  * CTA: **Adjust goal** (Premium) / **Set a goal** (Free/Pro)

> This is how “Take a rest day” becomes contextual and not just a random button.

### S5) Run Timeline (existing, but “Story simplified”)

* Default view in Story: **Pace + HR** (and Elevation if you want one overlay).
* Hide the multi-toggles behind a single dropdown: “Metric: Pace/HR/Power/Cadence”
* Show **2–4 key markers** (AI-selected) on the timeline:

  * “HR drift begins”
  * “Big slowdown / stop”
  * “Strong finish”
  * “Form drop” (if cadence stream exists)

**Chips row stays** (Drift/Pacing/Quality/etc.), but cap to 3 chips in Story.

### S6) Performance Analysis (existing, Story version)

* Show **only 3 cards max** (you already have them):

  * Pace Analysis
  * Running Form
  * Heart Rate Zone
* Each card gets a single CTA: **“See evidence in Deep Dive”** (links to correct Deep Dive tab anchor)

### S7) Route & Details (existing, collapsed preview)

* In Story: show a **small map preview + 3 key details** (e.g., Elev gain, Stop time, Max HR)
* Add “Open full route & details” → Deep Dive Route tab

✅ **Story hard rule:** No full splits table. No 4-chart grid. No huge details table.

---

# 3) DEEP DIVE view: “Everything measurable + configurable”

**Goal:** analysts/enthusiasts can explore without cluttering Story.

## Deep Dive layout (use what you already have)

### D1) Header + Full Key Stats Strip (existing)

* Show all stats (distance/time/pace/HR/elev/power/cadence etc.)

### D2) Tabbed or Sectioned “Evidence” (recommended tabs)

Each tab is just your existing components in a clean grouping:

1. **Timeline**

* Full Run Timeline with toggles: Pace/HR/Power/Cadence + Elevation
* Marker legend, zoom/brush (optional)

2. **Splits**

* Detailed Splits Analysis (table / chart / analysis toggles)

3. **Heart Rate**

* Heart Rate Analysis chart + zones breakdown

4. **Cadence**

* Cadence Analysis chart

5. **Power**

* Power Analysis chart

6. **Route & Details**

* Full map + full details table

> If you don’t want tabs, keep sections but add a left “On this page” anchor nav.

### D3) Goal/Plan actions (sticky right rail)

* Keep **Take a rest day**, **Swap workout**, **Mark complete**, **Add note/tag**
* Show **Goal alignment details** here too (weekly totals, plan compliance)

---

# 4) Tiering that feels user-friendly (no confusion)

Key principle: **everyone gets Story**, but **depth + personalization** increases by tier. Avoid “you can’t even open Deep Dive”.

## Suggested gating by tier (mapped to your components)

### Free

* ✅ Story:

  * Header, capped Key Stats (5)
  * Coach Verdict (basic)
  * Next 48 Hours (basic guidance) + “Take a rest day” (if user has a plan, otherwise prompt)
  * Timeline (simplified, 1 default metric)
  * Performance Analysis cards (text-only)
  * Route preview
* 🔒 Deep Dive:

  * Route & Details (full) ✅
  * Splits: show **top-level only** (e.g., first N rows or summary) 🔒
  * HR/Cadence/Power charts blurred/locked 🔒
  * “vs last 42 days” comparisons locked 🔒

### Pro

* ✅ Story:

  * Everything Free, plus:
  * “vs last 42 days” deltas visible
  * Full chips row (drift/pacing/quality/etc.)
  * Timeline markers (2–4) + metric dropdown
* ✅ Deep Dive:

  * Full splits table + HR zones + cadence + power (if data exists)

### Premium

* ✅ Story:

  * Everything Pro, plus:
  * Goal Alignment card becomes “smart” (plan compliance, weekly targets, intensity distribution vs goal)
  * More actionable CTAs: “Reschedule tomorrow”, “Convert next workout to Z2”, “Reduce intensity this week”
* ✅ Deep Dive:

  * Adds “analysis mode” in splits (insight narratives, anomaly explanations)
  * Optional: “Ask AI about this activity” / “Compare to similar runs” (if you have it)

## Locking UX pattern (important)

When something is locked:

* Keep the component in place but **collapsed + teaser line**
* Button: **Unlock with Pro/Premium**
* Never block navigation; never show an empty page.

---

# 5) Dev acceptance criteria (so it ships clean)

1. **Story can be consumed in ~2 scrolls** on desktop.
2. Story always answers:

   * Grade/verdict
   * Why (3 insights max)
   * What next (goal-aware actions)
3. Deep Dive contains **all current charts/splits** without being shown in Story.
4. “Take a rest day” is accessible from Story and Deep Dive and:

   * If plan exists: modifies next scheduled workout day state
   * If no plan: prompts “Set a goal / start a simple plan” then applies

---

If you want, I can turn this into a **one-page developer ticket** with:

* component IDs (`<CoachVerdictCard/>`, `<Next48HoursCard/>`, `<GoalAlignmentCard/>`),
* exact visibility rules per tier,
* and navigation anchors (e.g., `#deepdive-splits`, `#deepdive-hr`).
