1) Aerobic Decoupling Calculator

What it does: Quantifies late-run aerobic fade on long runs.

Key inputs: Pace (or speed), heart rate (HR), timestamps; optional temp/elevation.

Core formulas / logic

Convert pace → speed (m/s).

Pa:HR per sample: PaHR = speed / HR.

Split run by elapsed time (50/50).

Robust central tendency per half (median or Theil–Sen).

Decoupling %: ((PaHR_second / PaHR_first) - 1) * 100.

Bands: ≤3% excellent, 3–5% good, 5–8% borderline, >8% fade.

Visualizations

Split-halves slopegraph (line tilts show drift).

Drift waterfall (bar per run, median line).

Durability curve (duration bucket vs median drift; breakpoint where >5%).

Optional heat-adjusted overlay toggle.

2) Race Predictor (10k / Half / Marathon)

What it does: Predicts race time with a confidence band; turns into pace tables.

Key inputs: Recent race/effort (D₁, T₁), target distance D₂; training consistency; optional course & weather.

Core formulas / logic

Riegel: T₂ = T₁ * (D₂ / D₁)^k with k≈1.06 (personalize by volume/durability: ~1.04–1.08).

Training Consistency Index (TCI): 1 − norm(stddev(weekly load)) (0–1).

Confidence band (80%): ± base_error(distance) × (1 + (1−TCI)*α); e.g., base ≈ 2.5% (10k), 3.5% (HM), 5% (M).

Weather/course adjustment: add time deltas from elevation/heat/wind models.

Visualizations

Fan/confidence plot (point + 80% interval).

Pace ladder (goal pace with ±5/±10s rungs).

Course profile + pace overlay (and gel markers).

Weather dial with net impact (+sec/mi or +sec/km).

3) Polarized vs Pyramidal Training Split Analyzer

What it does: Classifies intensity distribution and suggests next-week tweaks.

Key inputs: Time in Z1/Z2/Z3 over 28–42 days from HR (preferred) or pace/power; thresholds LT1/LT2 or estimates.

Core formulas / logic

Thresholds:

If Threshold HR known: LT2 = thrHR, LT1 ≈ 0.78 × LT2.

If HRmax only: LT1 ≈ 75% HRmax, LT2 ≈ 88% HRmax.

Pace fallback: zones by % of threshold pace.

Map samples to zones; compute %Z1/%Z2/%Z3.

Labels (typical rules):

Polarized: Z1 ≥ 70%, Z3 ≥ 10%, Z2 ≤ 20%

Pyramidal: Z1 > Z2 > Z3 with Z2 ≈ 10–25%

Threshold-heavy: Z2 ≥ 25%

Visualizations

Stacked area by week (Z1/Z2/Z3, plus total load line).

Ternary (triangle) pin with 1-week trail.

Zone Sankey (session types → zone time).

Prescription chips (e.g., “Z1 +80m”, “Z2 −20m”).

4) Cadence Drift & Form Stability Report

What it does: Detects form fade and variability; outputs a Form Stability Score (0–100).

Key inputs: Cadence (spm) time series; optional pace/HR; optional GCT/VO metrics.

Core formulas / logic

For each eligible run (≥45 min), robust fit: cadence vs time → slope drift (spm/hour).

Cadence variability (CV): std(cadence) / mean(cadence) × 100.

Stride-length proxy: stride = speed / (cadence/60); compute variability.

Score (0–100):
Score = 100 − (w1·norm(|drift|) + w2·norm(CV) + w3·norm(stride_var)), e.g., w1=0.5, w2=0.3, w3=0.2.

Heuristics: drift ≤2 spm/hr = stable; 2–5 mild; >5 significant.

Visualizations

Cadence vs time with robust trend band (slope annotated).

Stability gauge (0–100) with small “Drift/CV” readouts.

Weekly box/violin for cadence spread (narrow = stable).

Stride vs pace scatter with outlier flags.
