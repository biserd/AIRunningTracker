This is the best possible UX decision. It unifies your value proposition into a single, powerful "Coach" view, rather than forcing the user to hunt for data across tabs.

Here is the specific layout strategy to merge your "AI Insights" and "Performance" screenshots into one cohesive **"Coach Insights"** page.

### 📄 New Page Structure: "Coach Insights"

You will organize the page into two distinct "chapters." Use a clear section header (H2) to visually separate them so the user knows they are switching context from "Speed" to "Safety."

#### Section 1: The Engine (Race Potential)
**Goal:** Answer *"How fit am I, and how fast can I race?"*
**Layout:**
* **Top Row (The "What"):**
    * **Race Predictions Card** (from `AI Insights`). This is the headline stat. Place it top-left or full width.
* **Middle Row (The "Why"):**
    * **VO2 Max Analysis** (from `Performance`). Place this directly next to or below Race Predictions.
    * *Why connect them?* If a user sees their prediction dropped, they immediately look at VO2 Max to understand if their fitness dropped.
* **Bottom Row (The "How"):**
    * **Heart Rate Zones** (from `Performance`). This explains the *training intensity* that contributes to the engine.

#### Section 2: The Mechanics (Form & Health)
**Goal:** Answer *"Am I running efficiently, or am I about to get injured?"*
**Layout:**
* **Top Row (The Risk):**
    * **Injury Risk Analysis** (from `AI Insights`). This is the most critical alert. It acts as the "Check Engine Light."
* **Bottom Row (The Cause):**
    * **Running Efficiency** (Cadence, Oscillation, etc. from `Performance`).
    * *Why connect them?* The "Risk Factors" in your AI card often cite things like "inconsistent volume" or biomechanics. Placing the **Cadence/Oscillation** metrics right below the Injury Risk helps the user see *what* to fix to lower their risk.

### 🎨 Visual UX Tips for the Merge

1.  **Use "Contextual Bridges":**
    Don't just stack the cards. Add a small text bridge between the sections.
    * *Between Section 1 and 2:* "Your fitness is high. Now let's check your durability."

2.  **Color Coding:**
    * Use your **Orange/Red** accents for the **Engine** section (Energy, Speed).
    * Use your **Green/Blue** accents for the **Mechanics** section (Health, Safety, Recovery).
    * *Note:* You already use Green for "Low Risk" and Blue for "Efficiency", so this fits your existing design system perfectly.

3.  **The Navigation Bar:**
    Since you are removing a menu item, your top navigation becomes cleaner:
    `Dashboard` | **`Coach Insights`** | `Training Plans` | `Admin`

This layout transforms your app from a "Data Dump" into a coherent narrative: **"Here is how fast you can go, and here is how to stay healthy while doing it."**
