1) 100K plans that span many weeks (and actually make sense)
What has to change conceptually

A 100K plan can’t be generated as “week-by-week workouts” only. It needs a hierarchy:

Goal → Phases → Weeks → Days → Workout structure

So you generate top-down:

Macro plan (phases): Base → Build → Specific → Peak → Taper → Race → Recovery

Weekly targets: volume (time or miles), long-run duration, vert, intensity distribution

Daily schedule: place key sessions first, then fill easy/recovery/strength

Default phase template for 100K (example)

Base (4–8 weeks): aerobic volume + consistency + strides, light hills

Build 1 (4–6 weeks): long run grows, add hill strength + steady/tempo

Build 2 / Specific (4–8 weeks): trail specificity, vert, back-to-back long runs, fueling practice, race-pace blocks

Peak (2–3 weeks): biggest long run(s), biggest vert week, specificity highest

Taper (2–3 weeks): reduce volume, keep some intensity, sharpen, rest

Recovery (1–2 weeks): very easy + optional cross train

Rules that make it “real”

These are the guardrails your generator enforces:

Progression / deload

Volume progression: typically 2–3 build weeks + 1 cutback week

Cap week-to-week increase using athlete history (not a blind 10% rule):

If athlete is consistent: allow slightly faster progression

If inconsistent: slower ramp + more cutbacks

Long run + back-to-back

Long run as time-based (ultra reality): 2h → 2.5h → 3h → 3.5–5h depending on level

Add back-to-back (e.g., Sat long trail + Sun medium long) every ~2–3 weeks in specific phase

Protect recovery: hard long-run weekends force easier Mon/Tue

Intensity distribution (ultra-safe default)

Keep most training easy (classic polarized-ish):

~80–90% easy

10–20% quality (tempo, hills, fartlek)

Two “stress anchors” max most weeks:

1 quality session midweek (tempo/hills)

1 long-run block on weekend (sometimes back-to-back)

Specificity

Vert targets scale with race profile (flat 100K ≠ mountain 100K)

Add technical downhill/strength work if trail/mountain

Fueling practice scheduled weekly during specific phase

UI/UX upgrades (so users can trust it)

Phase timeline view (scrollable multi-week)

Weekly “targets bar” (volume, long run, vert, intensity minutes)

Regenerate controls at 3 levels:

regenerate a day / a week / a whole phase

“Why this week?” explanation: “Cutback week after 2 build weeks; protects fatigue before peak block.”

2) Two plans at the same time (HM + 50K) with sane day-to-day training
Don’t generate two separate calendars

If you literally create two plans, you’ll collide workouts and blow up load. Instead:

✅ One combined plan with multiple goals.

Think of it as: one schedule optimized against two objectives.

The model: goals + priorities + dates

Each goal has:

event date

distance/type (HM road, 50K trail)

target priority (slider or Primary/Secondary)

key requirements (HM: threshold/VO2 + pace skills; 50K: long duration, vert, fueling, durability)

Then you generate one plan that:

respects global constraints (max days/week, max long-run time, rest days)

respects stress budget (weekly load caps derived from athlete history)

places key sessions without stacking them dangerously

Conflict logic (the honest part)

If the HM and 50K are close together, you can’t peak for both. So the app should:

detect overlap: competing tapers/peaks

offer an explicit choice:

Primary race + Secondary “B race” (finish strong but not peaked)

Two peaks only if dates are far enough apart (with rebuild block)

Convert one goal into a training race (supported mode)

How day-to-day looks (example microcycle)

Assume: HM (speed/threshold) + 50K (endurance/trail). A sensible “dual-goal” week often looks like:

Mon: Rest or easy + mobility/strength

Tue: HM-quality (tempo / cruise intervals)

Wed: Easy aerobic

Thu: Hills or steady-state (can serve both)

Fri: Easy or rest (protect weekend)

Sat: Long trail run (50K-specific)

Sun: Medium-long easy (back-to-back durability)

Each workout is tagged with contribution:

Tue: mostly HM

Sat/Sun: mostly 50K

Thu: shared

UI: make the split visible

Each workout card shows icons: HM / 50K with contribution %

Weekly summary shows:

total volume

quality minutes

long-run duration

“goal split” (e.g., 35% HM / 65% 50K)

Conflict warnings: “Two key sessions too close (Tue hard + Thu hard). Choose which to keep hard.”
